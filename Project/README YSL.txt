The columns in this data file are the variables measured. The rows are the lakes (Poway, Murray, Miramar) and dates sampled.

Variables and their units (measured using YSI Professional Plus multiparameter probe):


sample_date = number of sampling days starting from the 12th sampling day
depth_m	= depth at which variables were recorded (meters)
water_temp_c = water temperature (degrees celsius)
barometric_pressure_mmhg = barometric pressure (millimeter of mercury)
dissolved_oxygen_percent_per_liter = dissolved oxygen (percent per liter)
dissolved_oxygen_mgL = dissolved oxygen (milligrams per liter)
conductivity_uScm = conductivity (microsiemens per centimeter)
ph = pH
ysi_salinity_ppt = salinity (parts per thousand)
