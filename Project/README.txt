The columns in this data file are the variables measured. The rows are the lakes (Poway, Murray, Miramar) and dates sampled.

Variables measured and their units:

julian_date = year number followed by day number. (For example, 13177 is the 177th day of 2013)
sampling_date = number of sampling days
h2o_temp_c = water temperature (degrees celsius) 
air_temp_c = air temperature (degrees celsius)
wind_speed_kph = wind speed (kilometers per hour)
ph = pH
total_alkalinity_ppm = total alkalinity (parts per million)
chlorophyll_a_ugL = chlorophyll-a (micrograms per liter)
salinity_ppt = salinity (parts per thousand)
pco2_water_ppm = partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the water (parts per million)
bacteria_number_per_L = bateria abundance (number per liter)
total_nitrogen_mgL = total nitrogen (milligrams per liter)
total_phosphorus_mgL = total phosphorus (milligrams per liter)
dissolved_organic_carbon_mgL = dissolved organic carbon (milligrams per liter)
particulate_organic_nitrogen_mgL = particulate organic nitrogen (milligrams per liter)
particulate_organic_carbon_mgL = particulate organic carbon (milligrams per liter)
co2_flux_mmol_m_day = carbon dioxide flux (millimoles per square meter (m-2) per day (day-1))
pco2_atmosphere_ppm = partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (parts per million)
zooplankton_community_avg_legnth_mm = mean length of zooplankton community sampled (millimeters)
zooplankton_community_biomass_mgL = biomass of zooplankton community sampled (milligrams per liter)
