## **Data Analysis:** *Seasonal Changes in Plankton Food Web Structure and Carbon Dioxide Flux from Southern California Reservoirs*
  

#### Goals of the Study  
The goal was to discover the impact fresh water reservoirs have on carbon cycling processes by looking at affects of lake characteristics on plankton/bacterial biomass and how that biomass affects the amount of CO2 released into the atmosphere or stored within the lake ecosystem.  
#### Methodology of the Study  
The methods primarily included sampling lake conditions, such as pH, salinity, dissolved O2, depth and temperature, at 27 different sites in California and sampling bacteria indigenous to those lakes for general biomass data. This was gathered through length and abundance measurements.   
#### Data Used  
The data is comprised of four tables: one comparison/summary with all necessary data to reach the conclusion in the paper, one with all the measurements taken from each lake sampled, and two describing characteristics of sampled bacteria, one for length and one for abundance. There are several gaps in the data matrix for bacterial length, and much of the data across tables two through four is unorganized in a chronological or numerical fashion. These inconsistencies will make the data very difficult to parse. All data files are in .csv format. The sizes of each table are as follows:  
1. Table one, general summary data = 150 rows of 24 measurement columns  
2. Table two, lake data = 639 rows of 12 measurement columns  
3. Table three, bacteria abundance data= 146 rows of 18 measurement columns  
4. Table four, bacteria length data = 2426 rows of 17 measurement columns  
  
#### My Analysis  
The analysis I will be performing will involve a partial rerun of the original experiment and a unique analysis of my own. I will be looking at the measurements taken of the lakes and correlating them to bacterial biomass, as in the original study. With this data I plan to compare the biomass of each individual species of bacteria within the same timeframe and within similar conditions in an attempt to determine competition within the ecosystems. This will be done by finding statistical significance (or insignificance) between the size increase in one species and the decrease in another when under statistically insignificant environmental differences.
