The columns in this data file are the number of individual zooplankton counted per sample. 
The rows are the lakes (Poway, Murray, Miramar) and dates sampled.

"julian_date" is the year number followed by day number. (For example, 13177 is the 177th day of 2013)

The "fraction_of_sample_counted" would be 1/# in the column. (For example, 64 would be 1/64th of the sample counted)
