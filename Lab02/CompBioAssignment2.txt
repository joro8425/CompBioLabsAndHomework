Ingredients
	•	1 cup (100 grams) blanched almond flour
	•	1/4 cup (32 grams) coconut flour
	•	1 teaspoon baking soda

	•	6 tablespoons (98 grams) natural almond butter
	•	1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
	•	1 large egg
	•	1 1/4 cups (213 grams) dark chocolate chips
Directions
	1.	In a medium mixing bowl, stir together the almond flour, coconut flour, baking soda and salt. Set aside.

Then stir in 1 cup (170 grams) chocolate chips. Place the bowl in the refrigerator for about 1 hour or until the dough is firm.
	4.	Preheat the oven to 350 °F (175 °C) and line a baking sheet with a piece of parchment paper.
	5.	Roll the dough into 8 (75-gram) balls and place the remaining 1/4 cup (43 grams) of chocolate chips on the top and on the sides of the dough balls. Place 4" apart on the prepared baking sheet. Press the cookies down lightly with the palm of your hand.
	6.	Bake for 11-14 minutes or until the surface of the center of the cookies no longer appears wet. They'll be very soft but will continue to cook as they sit on the cookie sheet.
