#Meta-Data of LogGrowthFunction( )

###Description
This file contains a function meant to calculate the logistic growth of a population over discrete time intervals, given all outside factors are excluded.

####Variables
All variables are changeable within the function with the variable designation followed by = followed by the desired number. 
ex. 
`LogGrowthFunction( n = 10, k = 20, r = .30, Gens = 40)`

 * n = Population abundance at given point in time. Default = 10.
 * k = Carrying capacity of the population. Default = 1000.
 * r = The growth rate of the population. Default = 0.05.
 * Gens = The number of generations the population will experience. Default = 20.
